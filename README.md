## Greetings to you, if you've come so far. 

I'm Breno from Brazil, and i've began my journey through coding in june/2020 and have learned a great deal so far.
Unfortunatly, the project I've worked the most so far isn't public, so I can't show you guys any of its source code.
But my main interest so far it's been web development - mostly backend, but it has been necessary to learn and improve my frontending abilities as well.

My main programming language is Python, but I've started to learn with C, so I kinda know the basics, even tough I've not been done anything with it for a while.
Also taking a deep dive into Flutter, which I never tought I would have to. All the projects I've been doing to study are here.

May you all be happy.
C'ya!
